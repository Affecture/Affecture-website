<h1 style="font-size: 2.5em;">How we measure</h1>
<p class="section" style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.5em;">Our hardware includes devices to measure brain, heart, and skin activity, and only takes 5 minutes to set up.</p>

<p class="section" style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.5em;">The headset we use to measure brain activity is safe and non-invasive, equipped with flexible sensors to comfortably record electrical activity from the user's scalp.</p>

<p class="section" style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.5em;">The bracelet, lightweight and placed on the tester's arm, measures both heart activity and skin activity without interfering with gameplay.</p>
