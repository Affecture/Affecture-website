# How we measure

Our hardware includes devices to measure brain, heart, and skin activity, and only takes 5 minutes to set up.

The headset we use to measure brain activity is safe and non-invasive, equipped with flexible sensors to comfortably record electrical activity from the user's scalp.

The bracelet, lightweight and placed on the tester's arm, measures both heart activity and skin activity without interfering with gameplay.
